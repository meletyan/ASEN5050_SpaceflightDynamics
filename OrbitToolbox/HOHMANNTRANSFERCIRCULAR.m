function [aTrans, tauTrans, dva, dvb, dv] = HOHMANNTRANSFERCIRCULAR(rInitial, rFinal, MU)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Computes velocities required to achieve a two-burn Hohmann transfer
%%% between two circular orbits.
%%%
%%% Input:  rInitial    -   Initial orbit radius
%%%           rFinal    -   Final orbit radius
%%%               MU    -   Gravitational parameter km^3/s^2
%%%
%%% Output:   aTrans    -   Semi-major axis of transfer orbit
%%%         tauTrans    -   Transfer time
%%%              dva    -   Burn 1 to get out of initial orbit
%%%              dvb    -   Burn 2 to achieve final orbit
%%%               dv    -   Total change in velocity
